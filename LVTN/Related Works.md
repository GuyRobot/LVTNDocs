***Woebot***
The conversational agent was built using Decision Tree and appropriate NLP algorithms and needs to be installed as a software in a stand-alone computer. All conversational responses are stored in a database. The specific area of application is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for anxiety and mood disorder targeting young adults that are college going students. During an evaluation exercise, participants were tutored on ‘how to use’ Woebot. There were several categories on which Woebot could provide therapy. PHQ-9 score (“a 9-item self report questionnaire that assesses the frequency and severity of depressive symptomatology within the previous 2 weeks.” [19]) was used to assess the state of the participants. Results showed that there was a significant improvement in the mean PHQ-9 score compared to controls in the mental condition of participants with 2 weeks of therapy. This was similar to other mobile app based interventions [10, 26, 50], however, the time taken for symptom improvement was in a quarter of the time (2:8 weeks). The only other study that is reported to have a significant effect within 2 weeks is a software application for treating borderline personality disorder. Readers may note that the proposed software applications viz. Mobilyz [10], Mobiletype [26] were for dealing particularly with depressive disorders. A comparison between mobile-based and stand-alone-computer-based intervention for depression showed that using mobile did not in any way affect the efficacy of the programme [50]. However, these software applications were not Chatbots, rather, they were strategies to use technology for coaching and therapy under the supervision of medical practitioners. However, and more recently, [22] studied the efficacy of Woebot on a cohort of 95 adults (age range 19 – 43 years) all of who were suffering from either depression or anxiety. This research finds that improvement after a 2-week program via Woebot was no different than that obtained via simple techniques such as “regular emails sent to [sic] people”. Furthermore, they reported a higher attrition rate in the cohort that were taking the Woebot-based therapy, which the authors speculate to be linked to Chatbots “still grappling with limitations in terms of content”. In making this remark, the authors are not just pointing to Woebot, rather to all such that are available to use.

***ChatPal***
Chatpal was tested on a cohort of around 348 citizens in the age
range of 18 − 73 years and with various professions such as students, teachers, assistant nurses, unemployed. Of these, 18% thought ChatPal was ‘very useful’, 53% thought it was ‘somewhat useful’, 10% rated it as neutral; the remaining did not report the bot to be useful at all. When the cohort were asked how much they believed the Chatbot changed their mental wellbeing, 83% reported either slight improvement or none at all. Overall, the authors did not notice any significant improvement in mental wellbeing using ChatPal; however, they propose blending the tool in normal mental health services such as to support the practitioners. We note that in an earlier report where these authors assessed the demand for a Chatbot from participants of a workshop [43], it seemed that participants liked the idea of the Chatbot regularly checking-in with the user, asking questions about emotional state or mood and tracking this over time. For repeated use of the Chatbot, participants felt that reflecting on previous conversations would be beneficial. Many also thought that the Chatbot should provide a space to share thoughts and feelings but also provide information. However, when indeed the Chatbot was proposed, and then tested on a different cohort, the outcome was certainly not as positive as during the assessment task. This indicates the complexity and variability in design and implementation of Chatbots. ChatPal is an ongoing development project, where the latest report is on implementation of event logging facilities to record and analyse the usage of the bot [7]

***Tess***
Tess is a web-based chatbot devised by X2AI Inc. (https://tess.x2ai.com/)
with access interface via SMS (on mobile) and Facebook Messenger application.
In a technical report (where authors are affiliated to X2AI), [25] provides a
synopsis on the three stages of Tess’s design and implementation. The
technology is based on machine learning algorithms integrated with
psycho-educational concepts and is said to be developed in conjunction and
collaboration with trained mental health professionals. They refer to Tess as a
“psychological artificial intelligence service”, designed to provide much needed
support to healthcare professionals, primarily targetting the services in United
States (US) and Canada, whose mental unwellness often goes unreported. In the second phase, extensive effort was put in terms of scripting Tess’s database by skilled professionals. The third phase is reported as a work in progress (during 2019) where Tess was being prepared to be tested on patient groups.
Today, on their website, X2AI claims that “Tess has been clinically validated to
help people feel better: Chatting with Tess was found to reduce symptoms of
depression (-13%) and anxiety (-18%).” Indeed, [20] performed a randomised
control trial to observe the efficacy of Tess on University students in the USA.
They reported a significant decrease in both depression and anxiety levels after
2–4 weeks, measured on PH-9 and GAD-7 scales respectively and using
multivariate analysis of covariance (manova). The average age of the 74
participants was 22.9, where 70% were female, and 51% and 41% were of Asian
and White respectively. The control group in the study were given access to an
‘e-book on depression among college students’
(https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/depression-listing), as
opposed to communicating with Tess like the test groups. Also, there were two
test groups; one that received daily message from Tess on varying contents over a period of 2 weeks, and the other that received biweekly message from Tess but on a specific content over a period of 4 weeks. Both test groups showed significant decrease in symptoms upon interacting with Tess. However, user satisfaction survey received a mixed response with many participants reporting Tess getting confused and misunderstanding when receiving unexpected user input.
Another study [16], while looking at efficacy of Tess to deal with depressive
symptoms, was unique in providing an insight into the chatbot’s framework, i.e.
how would the users be taken through the contents implementing BITs. The
paper explains the ‘module’ format of Tess and studies the chatbot by observing how 354 users interacted with Tess’s depression modules. Overall, their study recommends further work that needs to be done to make current Chatbots to be user friendly as well as trustworthy in context to the job that it is entrusted with.
Similar recommendations were also provided in a commentary [48] on a
feasibility study addressing pediatric obesity [46], a public health matter of
growing concern in the USA, that used Tess for CBT of obese children. [48]
raises some very apt and timely concerns, the most important of which are: first, there is still not enough labelled data available for Tess to perform reliable
therapy; second, not enough safety and privacy related concerns are addressed, especially where children are concerned; third, the cohort on which Tess was tested was from 9-18 years that seemed generic rather than targetted and personalised treatment, considering children grow at faster and variable rates specifically during this age range.
From this review, our assessment is that Tess looks promising in terms of
coaching- and conversational therapy-based treatments, albeit with a lot of gaps that needs to be improved upon as a continuous process based on usage
feedbacks and other indicators. However, we did not try this ourselves as that
would require requesting paid access on their website
